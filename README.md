Cross-origin isolation ([COOP and COEP](https://web.dev/coop-coep/)) through a service worker for situations in which you can't control the headers (e.g. GH pages).

## Usage

1. Download `coi-serviceworker.js` (ðŸ”¸ ~~or `coi-serviceworker.min.js`~~).
2. Put it next to your index file (or in any folder above it)
3. Add to your HTML file:
    ```html
    <script src="coi-serviceworker.js"></script>
    ```

This script will reload the page on the user's first load to magically add the required COOP and COEP headers in a service worker.

**Rules**:
* It must be in a separate file, you can't bundle it along with your app.
* It can't be loaded from a CDN: it must be served from your own origin.
* Your page will still need to be either served from HTTPS, or served from localhost.


### ðŸ”¸ ~~Extra credits: download from NPM~~

~~You can install this package from npm:~~
~~npm i --save coi-serviceworker~~

~~You will still have to tell your bundler to put the file alongside your bundle. Something like this will do the trick:~~

~~cp node_modules/coi-serviceworker/coi-serviceworker.js dist/~~

## ðŸ”¸ Customization
You can customize the behavior by defining a variable `coi` in the global scope (i.e. on the `window` object):

```javascript
window.coi = {
    // If true, any existing service worker will be de-registered (and nothing else will happen).
    shouldDeregister: false,
    // Decide whether to use "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless" or not.
    // See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy#browser_compatibility
    coepCredentialless: true,
    // Decide whether to retry with require-corp if credentialless fails.
    coepDegrade: true,
    // Override this if you want to prompt the user and do reload at your own leisure. Maybe show the user a message saying:
    // "Click OK to refresh the page to enable <...>"
    // You can see window.sessionStorage.getItem("coiReloadedBySelf") for the reason to reload.
    doReload: window.location.reload,
    // Set to true if you don't want coi to log anything to the console.
    quiet: false
}

// ðŸ”¸ or directly update/set one option
window?.coi?.coepDegrade = false
window?.coi?.doReload = () => {
  myCustomHandler()
  // ... Do stuff ...
  window.location.reload()
}
```
